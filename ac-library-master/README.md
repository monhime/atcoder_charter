## Policy

Our goal of this project is to achieve that

- **every AtCoder users** can use this library with **minimum efforts of studying about PC**
- maximize convenience for **the usage in competitive programming**. We completely ignore other usages.
- no bugs. This is a fantasy, but we pursue this.

By this policy, we ignore some manners of C++ intentionally. For example,

- we don't use `size_t`, but use `int`.
- Segtree handles function pointers, not functional objects.
- and so on...

## Direction of this project

We haven't decided whether we should increase this library's contents or not because there are pros and cons.
If you are interested in this topic, please join the discussion in [The Announcement on Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/82400).

For now, we are not planning to add new features, and we use this repository only for

- collecting issues
- recording the changelogs
- versioning our releases

## Contributing

We accept issues/PRs **only from AtCoder users**.

We would appreciate it if you would report our mistakes like a typo, or, more importantly, bugs!

As mentioned above, we haven't decided which way to go. Therefore we close feature requests for now.
